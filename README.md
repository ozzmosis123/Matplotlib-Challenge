# Matplotlib-Challenge

Python Pandas and Matplotlib modules are used to create new data and visualize results using various bar charts, scatter plots, and pie charts. 

RESULTS
The tumor volume was lower when the weight of the mouse was less as is shown in the correlation study.

Capomulin and ramicane had the lowest tumor volume averages as is shown in the box plots.

Capmulin and Ramicane had the most mice do their regimen. 

The male and female mouse distribution was very equal. 

Infubinol was the only regimen that came back with an outlier with a way smaller tumor volume than the rest in that study.
